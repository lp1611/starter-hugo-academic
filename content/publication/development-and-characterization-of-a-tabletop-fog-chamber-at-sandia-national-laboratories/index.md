abstract: "Atmospheric fog is a common degraded visual environment (DVE) that
  reduces sensing and imaging range and resolution in complex ways not fully
  encapsulated by traditional metrics. As such, better physical models are
  required to describe imaging systems in a fog environment. We have developed a
  tabletop fog chamber capable of creating repeatable fog-like environments for
  controlled experimentation of optical systems within this common DVE. We
  present measurement of transmission coefficients and droplet size distribution
  in a multiple scattering regime using this chamber. "
