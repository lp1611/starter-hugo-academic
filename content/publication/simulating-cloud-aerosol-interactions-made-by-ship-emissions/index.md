  Satellite imagery can detect temporary cloud trails or ship tracks formed from
  aerosols emitted

  from large ships traversing our oceans, a phenomenon that global climate models cannot directly

  reproduce. Ship tracks are observable examples of marine cloud brightening, a potential solar cli-

  mate intervention that shows promise in helping combat climate change. Whether or not a shipâ€™s

  emission path visibly impacts the clouds above and how long a ship track visibly persists largely

  depends on the exhaust type and properties of the boundary layer with which it mixes. In order

  to be able to statistically infer the longevity of ship-emitted aerosols and characterize atmospheric

  conditions under which they form, a first step is to simulate, with mathematical surrogate model

  rather than an expensive physical model, the path of these cloud-aerosol interactions with parame-

  ters that are inferable from imagery. This will allow us to compare when/where we would expect

  to ship tracks to be visible, independent of atmospheric conditions, with what is actually observed

  from satellite imagery to be able to infer under what atmospheric conditions do ship tracks form.

  In this paper, we will discuss an approach to stochastically simulate the behavior of ship induced

  aerosols parcels within naturally generated clouds. Our method can use wind fields and potentially

  relevant atmospheric variables to determine the approximate movement and behavior of the cloud-

  aerosol tracks, and uses a stochastic differential equation (SDE) to model the persistence behavior

  of cloud-aerosol paths. This SDE incorporates both a drift and diffusion term which describes the

  movement of aerosol parcels via wind and their diffusivity through the atmosphere, respectively.

  We successfully demonstrate our proposed approach with an example using simulated wind fields

  and ship paths.
