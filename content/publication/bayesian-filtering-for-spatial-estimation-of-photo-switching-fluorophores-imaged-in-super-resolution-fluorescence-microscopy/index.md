abstract: The success of many Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy methods
  lie in the exploitation of the inherent stochasticity of a light emitting
  molecule's photon emission state, allowing sparse subsets of molecules to be
  spatially detected with high precision. This photo-switching behavior,
  however, induces multiple localizations from each molecule during an imaging
  experiment, which therefore gives rise to misleading representations of their
  true spatial locations. By formulating a state-space model relating true
  molecular positions with observation sets collected across time, we show that
  the full Bayes filter for this problem can be derived and positions recovered
  via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler.
