abstract: A key difficulty that arises from real event data is imprecision in
  the recording of event time-stamps. In many cases, retaining event times with
  a high precision is expensive due to the sheer volume of activity. Combined
  with practical limits on the accuracy of measurements, binned data is common.
  In order to use point processes to model such event data, tools for handling
  parameter estimation are essential. Here we consider parameter estimation of
  the Hawkes process, a type of self-exciting point process that has found
  application in the modeling of financial stock markets, earthquakes and social
  media cascades. We develop a novel optimization approach to parameter
  estimation of binned Hawkes processes using a modified
  Expectation-Maximization algorithm, referred to as Binned Hawkes Expectation
  Maximization (BH-EM). Through a detailed simulation study, we demonstrate that
  existing methods are capable of producing severely biased and highly variable
  parameter estimates and that our novel BH-EM method significantly outperforms
  them in all studied circumstances. We further illustrate the performance on
  network flow (NetFlow) data between devices in a real large-scale computer
  network, to characterize triggering behavior. These results highlight the
  importance of correct handling of binned data. Supplementary materials for
  this article are available online.
