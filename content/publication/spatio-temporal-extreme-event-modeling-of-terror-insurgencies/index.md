  Extreme events with potential deadly outcomes, such as those organized by
  terror groups, are highly

  unpredictable in nature and an imminent threat to society. In particular, quantifying the likelihood of

  a terror attack occurring in an arbitrary space-time region and its relative societal risk, would facilitate

  informed measures that would strengthen national security. This paper introduces a novel self-exciting

  marked spatio-temporal model for attacks whose inhomogeneous baseline intensity is written as

  a function of covariates . Its triggering intensity is succinctly modeled with a Gaussian Process

  prior distribution to flexibly capture intricate spatio-temporal dependencies between an arbitrary

  attack and previous terror events. By inferring the parameters of this model, we highlight specific

  space-time areas in which attacks are likely to occur. Furthermore, by measuring the outcome of an

  attack in terms of the number of casualties it produces, we introduce a novel mixture distribution

  for the number of casualties. This distribution flexibly handles low and high number of casualties

  and the discrete nature of the data through a Generalized ZipF distribution. We rely on a customized

  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to estimate the model parameters. We illustrate the

  methodology with data from the open source Global Terrorism Database (GTD) that correspond

  to attacks in Afghanistan from 2013-2018. We show that our model is able to predict the intensity

  of future attacks for 2019-2021 while considering various covariates of interest such as population

  density, number of regional languages spoken, and the density of population supporting the opposing

  government.
