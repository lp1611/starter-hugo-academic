I am a senior statistician at Sandia National Laboratories. My research interests broadly lie in the fields of computational statistics, simulation-based statistical learning (particle methods, Monte Carlo approaches, Approximate Bayesian Computation) of stochastic processes and Bayesian nonparametrics. Other areas of interest include spatial-temporal statistics, extreme value analysis and Bayesian variable selection. Applications include in bioinformatics and biological imaging, cyber-security, climatology and social sciences.
